## Description
This application is my first personal showcase project. Featuring a clean and responsive user interface, this calculator supports basic arithmetic, decimal, and unary operations. It was modeled after the pre-iOS 18 calculator, allowing for certain expressions to be calculated automatically as they are entered in. I refrained from using any evaluate function; instead, I chose to dynamically track and update variables in JavaScript. Additionally, I utilized the jQuery library to instantaneously update the display, allowing for a smooth user experience. 

## Directory Structure
* **_index.html_** - Utilizes a grid layout for the calculator contianer and buttons
* **_style.css_** - Adds all layout (container), component (button), and state (hover) styles. 
* **_script.js_** - Contains all of the logic for the calculator to work. Keeps track of variables, handles all button input, and updates the display.
