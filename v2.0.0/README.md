## Description
In the revised version of my showcase project Basic Front-End Calculator, I added only one new feature, which is keyboard support for calculator input. My primary focus on this revision was better conforming to professional coding standards and conventions, including: 
* Naming Conventions
* Semantic HTML
* Sectioned CSS (into the following sections: reset, global, layout, component, state, and responsive styles)
* Responsive Web Design
* Documentation

To accomplish this, I refactored all of the code from version 1.0.0 of this project, focusing much on the efficincy of my JavaScript file.
